## What if…

…Cobblemon had more config options?

## Features

- Optionally prevent out-of-battle captures. Also mark specific PokeBall types as exceptions to this rule (don’t accidentally break Safari Ball’s functionality!).
- Optionally prevent Pokémon from dropping items outside of battle.

## Dependencies

## Testing

Run the game with the mod installed at least once in order to generate the default config. Throw a PokeBall at a wild Pokémon without engaging it in a Pokémon battle, and observe how it works as usual. Hop into the config, change `outOfBattleCaptures.default` to `false`, fire the game back up, try throwing a PokeBall at a wild Pokémon without engaging it in a Pokémon battle, and observe how the PokeBall is rejected.
